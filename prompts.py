     • 4–6 bullet points with **strong action verbs**, **bolded technologies**, and **quantified impact**.
     • Highlight backend, microservices, API design, DevOps, performance optimization, and scalability work.
     • Use natural developer phrasing (e.g., “Optimized API throughput by 35% using **Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL**.”)

   - Keep degree, institute, and duration in one clean line.

6) ## Projects / Certifications / Achievements
